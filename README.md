# Hackadon2020
## Just an idea for the sustainability track 
Inspired by hackathon task largely due to significant number of data points https://github.com/sberbank-ai/no_flood_with_ai_aij2020 which has project description https://github.com/sberbank-ai/no_flood_with_ai_aij2020/blob/main/README.en.md and targets flood prevention.\
They have compilled data https://github.com/kclosu/no_flood_with_ai/tree/main/models and have illustated its potential applicability https://github.com/sberbank-ai/no_flood_with_ai_aij2020/blob/main/baseline.ipynb .\
We could use this data to build ML algorithm to forecast 10-day level of water based on number of variables or compille one for other places/cities/countries.\
How it applies: global warming will increase the average level of water all over the world making our contribution significant for stress-testing and building defence against the rising tides.
